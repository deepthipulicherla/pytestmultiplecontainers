What Are Markers in Pytest?
Markers in Pytest are labels or annotations you attach to test functions to categorize, filter, or modify their behavior. They help you:

Group tests logically (e.g., @pytest.mark.regression)

Run subsets of tests (pytest -m regression)

Skip or conditionally skip tests (@pytest.mark.skip, @pytest.mark.skipif)

Parametrize tests (@pytest.mark.parametrize)

Apply custom behavior (e.g., platform-specific, flaky tests, etc.)
